# This minimal drake workflow demonstrates the file structure from
# https://books.ropensci.org/drake/projects.html#code-files.
# It is not the only way to organize R scripts for drake,
# but this pattern is helpful.

source("R/packages.R")  # Load your packages, e.g. library(drake).
source("R/functions.R") # Define your custom code as a bunch of functions.
source("R/plan.R")      # Create your drake plan.

# Call make() to run your work.
# Your targets will be stored in a hidden .drake/ cache,
make(plan)

# If you do not change any code or data,
# subsequent make()'s do not build targets.

# Load your targets back into your session with loadd() and readd().
