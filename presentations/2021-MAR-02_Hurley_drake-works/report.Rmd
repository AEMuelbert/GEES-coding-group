```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

```

## Intro

`drake` is cool!

# Methods

```{r echo=FALSE}
loadd(daymet_clean)

```


Download data. In total we have `r nrow(daymet_clean)` observations from `r dplyr::n_distinct(daymet_clean$site)` sites!

# Results

Annual data fluctuates:

```{r echo=FALSE}

readd(plot_all_sites) # readd "executes" automatically


```

And trends in June were unclear:


```{r echo=FALSE}

readd(plot_june_models) 


```

```{r}
loadd(iris_data)

iris_data %>% head()
```


# Discussion

We need more work, but `drake` is still cool. 

# Conclusion

We should check out `targets`, though.
