## Motivation {.smaller .build}

Often:

- Complex analyses
- many steps that depend on each other
- not sure which outputs were up to date
- calculations could benefit from parallel implementation / HPC

- lets you structure your workflow into individual steps
- analyzes your workflow
- skips steps with up-to-date results
- orchestrates everything with optional distributed computing (HPC, parallel, etc.)

## drake.. {.build}

<br>
<br>

Has extensive documentation (follow [link](https://books.ropensci.org/drake/))

<br>
<br>

Is being superseded by `targets` (follow [link](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/))

## Getting started

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
drake::drake_example() # generates working project

drake::use_drake()
```

$\uparrow$ Provides a useful template with folders and files..

.. and assumes a *functional programming* paradigm.

<br>

**All analyses steps are functions.**

- can be tested against expected outputs
- can be debugged (!!!)
- can be applied with various parameters (for parallel computing)


## Good to know: 

## Good to know: Files and Folders {.smaller .build}


- `packages.R`: libraries used during analyses  
$\rightarrow$ keep adding
- `functions.R`: functions used during analyses   
$\rightarrow$ keep building and testing
- `plan.R`: executes functions (*targets*) and manages dependencies  
$\rightarrow$  extensive adjustment with targets, see [here](https://books.ropensci.org/drake/plans.html)
- `make.R` / `_drake.R`: controls execution  
$\rightarrow$ rarely need to touch

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

plan <- drake::drake_plan(
    
    downloaded_data = get_data(),
    
    cleaned_data = clean_data(downloaded_data),
    
    models = run_stat_model(cleaned_data),
    
    overview_figure = make_figure(cleaned_data,
                                  models))


```


## Good to know: Files and Folders {.smaller .build}

<font size="+1">
**Existing scripts can be converted**:  
`drake::code_to_function()`     
</font>

```
01_get_data.R
02_clean_data.R
03_run_models.R
```

.. are converted into custom functions for use in `plan.R`.  
.. but this is *not recommended for starting new projects*

## Good to know: {.smaller .build}

## Good to know: Executing {.smaller .build}

 
**Run!**  

- `drake::make()` $\rightarrow$ on servers  
- `drake::r_make()` $\rightarrow$ in interactive `R` sessions  


**Check!**  

- `drake::outdated()`  
$\rightarrow$ show outdated dependencies   

- `drake::vis_drake_graph()`   
$\rightarrow$ show interactive dependency   graph    

- `drake::loadd()`, `drake::readd()`  
$\rightarrow$ load plan targets into curren `R` session env.


**Manage!**  

- `drake::file_in()`, `file_out()`, `knitr_in()`   
$\rightarrow$ for `drake` to track dependencies of external files
